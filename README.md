This is the repository for the QIndia - Quantum Beginners Initiative. It uses the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme. .

## What is QIndia - Quantum Beginners Initiative ?

Blog and tutorial series focused on helping Quantum beginners find their footing. There are many resources out there for people to learn about quantum computing. However we would like to create a place where absolute beginners can start from, like a “start here” section that then takes them step-by-step through the process of understanding the minimum before exploring the world of quantum computing for themselves. The content will be a combination of original creations by the team and links to specific sections of already existing content

## What can you find here?

- Blog and tutorial series focused on Quantum Computing .

- We will provide resources that will guide interested students in understanding Quantum computing from a beginners perspective 

- We also intend, at some point, to create a challenge exercise for the readers to try hands on Exercises on Quantum algorithms 

- A list of Open source Educational resources for the readers to learn from and get a good understanding of the subject 

## Todo
- [ ] Adding a Work in Progress Banner header on top of the website
