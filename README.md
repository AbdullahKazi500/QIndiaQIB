## What is QIndia - Quantum Beginners Initiative ?

Blog and tutorial series with Qiskit focused on helping Quantum beginners find their footing. There are many resources out there for people to learn about quantum computing. However we would like to create a place where absolute beginners can start from, like a “start here” section that then takes them step-by-step through the process of understanding the minimum before exploring the world of quantum computing for themselves. The content will be a combination of original creations by the team and links to specific sections of already existing content

## What can you find here?

- Blog and tutorial series focused on Quantum Computing .

- We will provide resources that will guide interested students in understanding Quantum computing from a beginners perspective 

- We also intend, at some point, to create a challenge exercise for the readers to try hands on Exercises on Quantum algorithms 

- A list of Open source Educational resources for the readers to learn from and get a good understanding of the subject

  ## *beta* directory


#### In the **beta** directory of our repository, we have a collection of work-in-progress folders and files. It consists of two folders Documentation and Tutorials.

The documentation folder is organized into different sections, each focusing on specific topics related to quantum computing. These sections serve as 
dedicated repositories of knowledge, covering fundamental concepts, and algorithms of quantum computing. Each section within the documentation folder is 
designed to provide clear and concise documentation, enabling users to grasp the concepts and techniques involved in quantum computing.

- The [Documentation/section-1](beta/Documentation/section-1) folder focuses on providing comprehensive information and documentation related to quantum mechanics. 
Here, you can find files that cover various topics and concepts specific to section 1.

- Similarly, the [Documentation/section-2](beta/Documentation/section-2) folder contains documentation files specifically tailored to section 2. 
This section is related to **introduction to quantum computing**.

- Furthermore, we have the [Documentation/section-3](beta/Documentation/section-3) folder, which concentrates on documenting the content of section 3. 
This section delves into **quantum algorithms and protocols**.

Additionally, we have a separate folder called **Tutorials** within the **beta** directory consisting on hands-on tutorial sections with [**Qiskit**](https://qiskit.org/). 
- The [Tutorials/section-2](beta/Tutorials/section-2) folder is dedicated to tutorials related to introduction to quantum computing and Qiskit.
  These tutorials offer step-by-step guides and practical examples to help users effectively utilize the features and functionalities of Qiskit.

- Similarly, the [Tutorials/section-2](beta/Tutorials/section-3) folder contains tutorials specifically focused on implementing different quantum algorithms with Qiskit.

*Please note that the files within these folders are currently under development and review. We are continuously working on refining and expanding the documentation and tutorials to ensure they provide the most accurate and comprehensive information possible. Once the review process is complete, the reviewed files will be moved to a separate 'reviewed' folder for easy access and reference.*
